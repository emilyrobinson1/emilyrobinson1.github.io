    "title": "Did Caitlin Clark’s Rookie Season Transform the Indiana Fever?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Despite the Indiana Fever finishing their 2024 season with a not-great record of 20-20, Caitlin Clark, the number one WNBA draft pick of 2024, averaged 19.2 points per game, proving her impact beyond wins and losses.\nComing off of 4 years at the University of Iowa, Clark was a household name. Objectively, Clark is a sharp point guard who’s three pointer shots were a trustworthy source of success for the Hawkeyes. Now in the WNBA, it’s debated across the sports world whether or not Caitlin Clark is as crucial to her team in her professional career as she was in college, leading the Hawkeyes to a record of 31-7 in 2023.\nTo fully understand her influence, we start with her general stats. Interestingly enough, Clark’s rookie year statistics are similar to the top veteran players in the WNBA.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"wnba_players_stats.csv\")\n\nrookies_2024 &lt;- players %&gt;%\n  select(Player, PTS, AST, REB)\n\nclark_stats &lt;- rookies_2024 %&gt;%\n  filter(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\")\n\nrookies_2024_long &lt;- rookies_2024 %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"Stat\", value = \"Value\", PTS, AST, REB)\n\ntop_15_rookies &lt;- rookies_2024 %&gt;%\n  group_by(Player) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_PTS = sum(PTS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, Total_PTS) %&gt;%\n  select(Player)\n\nrookies_top_15 &lt;- rookies_2024 %&gt;%\n  filter(Player %in% top_15_rookies$Player)\n\nrookies_top_15_long &lt;- rookies_top_15 %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"Stat\", value = \"Value\", PTS, AST, REB)\n\nrookies_top_15_long &lt;- rookies_top_15_long %&gt;%\n  mutate(Player_Color = ifelse(Player == \"Caitlin Clark\", \"Caitlin Clark\", \"Other Players\"))\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\"Caitlin Clark\" = \"gold\", \"Other Players\" = \"#A9A9A9\")\n\nggplot(rookies_top_15_long, aes(x = Player, y = Value, fill = Player_Color)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  \n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Caitlin Clark\", y=20, label=\"19.2\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Caitlin Clark Dominates the Top 10\",  \n    subtitle = \"Rookie Clark points per game average compares to veteran WNBA players\",  \n    caption = \"Source: herhoopstats.com | By Emily Robinson\",\n    y = \"Average Points Per Game\",  \n    x = \"Top WNBA Players 2024\"  \n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = team_colors) +  # Apply custom colors\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12, color = \"black\"),  \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, color = \"black\"),  \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, color = \"black\"),  \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", color = \"black\"),  \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = \"black\"),  \n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\", linetype = \"dashed\"),  \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA)  \n  ) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that Caitlin Clark sits competitively in the top 10 point-collectors in the WNBA. Her average is similar to two-time gold medalist, Jewell Loyd’s, who was drafted to the WNBA in 2015 by the Seattle Storm. Clark sits only slightly behind Breanna Stewart, three-time gold medalist. Stewart was the first overall pick in the 2016 WNBA draft by the Seattle Storm. So why should we care? Let’s look at the season that Indiana had in 2024.\n\n\nCode\nIndianaFever &lt;- read_csv(\"team_score.csv\")\n\nIndianaFever &lt;- IndianaFever %&gt;%\n  select(game_date, Score, `W/L`) %&gt;%\n  mutate(`W/L` = factor(`W/L`, levels = c(\"W\", \"L\")))  \n\nggplot(IndianaFever, aes(x = game_date, y = Score)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"gray40\", size = 1) +  \n  geom_point(aes(color = `W/L`), size = 3) +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"W\" = \"green\", \"L\" = \"red\")) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Clark Takes Off While The Fever Remains Mid\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite Clark's individual success, the Fever found themselves stuck.\",\n    caption = \"Source: herhoopstats.com | By Emily Robinson\",\n    x = \"Game Date\",\n    y = \"Team Score\",\n    color = \"Game Result\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fever had just as many losses as wins in 2024. A 20-20 record doesn’t seem that great when it places them 6th in the league out of 12 teams. Except for the fact that the Fever finished 2024 with their best season record since 2012. The Fever qualified for the playoffs in 2024. That’s the first time since 2016. Now let’s see what exactly changed that boosted the Indiana Fever to have such a, relatively, great season in 2024.\n\n\nCode\nIndianaFever &lt;- read_csv(\"team_score.csv\") %&gt;%\n  select(Score, points, `W/L`) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Rest_of_Team = Score - points,  \n    win = if_else(`W/L` == \"W\", \"Win\", \"Loss\")  \n  )\n\n\nIndianaFever &lt;- IndianaFever %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(points), !is.na(win), !is.na(Score))\n\nggplot(IndianaFever, aes(x = Score, y = points, size = win, color = win)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_size_manual(values = c(\"Loss\" = 4, \"Win\" = 10)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Win\" = \"green\", \"Loss\" = \"red\")) +\n\n  labs(\n    title = \"Caitlin Controls The Fever's Numbers\",\n    subtitle = \"The Fever can't make up for it when Clark doesn't put up her usual points.\",\n    caption = \"Source: herhoopstats.com | By Emily Robinson\",\n    \n    x = \"Indiana Fever's Final Score\",\n    y = \"Caitlin Clark's Points\",\n    size = \"Game Result\",\n    color = \"Game Result\"\n  ) +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe games that Caitlin Clark scored more points in, the team projected success. The games that Clark had less points scored individually, the team was more often to lose. If we were to base our expectations of the Indiana Fever’s future seasons, I’d say as long as they have Caitlin Clark as a trustworthy point guard, it’s only up from here."
